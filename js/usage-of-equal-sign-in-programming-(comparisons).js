/*
The Usage of the Equal Sign in programming (Comparisons)

// simple math
1 + 2 = 3

//change the boolean value of the variable to the opposite of it (if the boolean was true is going to be false)
var boolean = true;
boolean = !boolean (now boolean = false)

//non-strict comparisons (compare the variable only)
//afirmative
3 == "3" //true
//negative
3 != "3" //false

//strict comparisons (compare the variable and the type of that variable)
//afirmative
3 === "3" //false
//negative
3 !== "3" //true
